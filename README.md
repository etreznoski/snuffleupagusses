### Data Sources
Latitude / Longitude Data (https://opendata.fcc.gov/Wireline/Geography-Lookup-Table/v5vt-e7vw)
Internet Speed Data (https://opendata.fcc.gov/Wireline/Area-Table-June-2020-V1/ktav-pdj7)
 Census Data for comparatory variables?
 
### Basic Plan
Use FCC data on internet speed to explore the relationship between high-speed (<-- to be defined) internet access and community measures such as median income, average age, education level, etc. 

To do this, we may need to create GeoJSON data from the FCC sources.

### Visualizations
Heat Map
Map with Layers
Interactive Scatterplot (Internet Speed on y, other variables on x) (Dropdown for state)
